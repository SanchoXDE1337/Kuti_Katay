            Skateboarding, form of recreation and sport,
            popular among youths, in which a person rides standing
            balanced on a small board mounted on wheels. Considered
            one of the so-called extreme sports, skateboarding as a
            professional sport boasts a range of competitions, including
            vertical and street-style events. Vertical skating (also called “vert”)
            features aerial acrobatics performed in half-pipes that were originally
            built to emulate empty swimming pools. Street style features tricks performed
            in a real or simulated urban environment with stairs, rails, ledges, and
            other obstacles. Skateboarding has developed as a youth subculture that
            emphasizes creativity and individuality. It is an alternative to
            mainstream team sports, which are more formally organized and largely
            controlled by adults.

            The first commercial skateboards appeared in 1959, but crude
            homemade versions of skateboards, often consisting of nothing more
            than old roller-skate wheels attached to a board, were first built after
            the turn of the 20th century. In the early 1960s, skateboard manufacturers such
            as Makaha and Hobie attempted to capitalize on the rising popularity of surfing
            by promoting skateboarding, then known as “sidewalk surfing,” as an alternative
            diversion when no rideable waves were available.
